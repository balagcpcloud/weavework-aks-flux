With the power of Flux together with Terraform, TF-controller allows you to GitOps-ify infrastructure, and application resources, in the Kubernetes and Terraform universe, at your own pace. \"At your own pace\" means you don't need to GitOps-ify everything at once. TF-controller offers many GitOps models: GitOps Automation Model: GitOps your Terraform resources from the provision steps to the enforcement steps, like a whole EKS cluster. Hybrid GitOps Automation Model: GitOps parts of your existing infrastructure resources. For example, you have an existing EKS cluster. You can choose to GitOps only its nodegroup, or its security group. State Enforcement Model: You have a TFSTATE file, and you'd like to use GitOps enforce it, without changing anything else. Drift Detection Model: You have a TFSTATE file, and you'd like to use GitOps just for drift detection, so you can decide to do things later when a drift occurs. To get started, follow the getting started guide. Features Multi-Tenancy : TF-controller supports multi-tenancy by running Terraform plan and apply inside Runner Pods. When specifying .metadata.namespace and .spec.serviceAccountName , the Runner Pod uses the specified ServiceAccount and runs inside the specified Namespace. These settings enable the soft multi-tenancy model, which can be used within the Flux multi-tenancy setup. This feature is available since v0.9.0. GitOps Automation for Terraform : With setting .spec.approvePlan=auto , it allows a Terraform object to be reconciled and act as the representation of your Terraform resources. The TF-controller uses the spec of the Terraform object to perform plan , apply its associated Terraform resources. It then stores the TFSTATE of the applied resources as a Secret inside the Kubernetes cluster. After .spec.interval passes, the controller performs drift detection to check if there is a drift occurred between your live system, and your Terraform resources. If a drift occurs, the plan to fix that drift will be generated and applied automatically. This feature is available since v0.3.0. Drift detection : This feature is a part of the GitOps automation feature. The controller detects and fixes drift for your infrastructures, based on the Terraform resources and their TFSTATE . This feature is available since v0.5.0. Drift detection is enabled by default. You can use the field .spec.disableDriftDetection to disable this behaviour. This feature is available since v0.7.0. The Drift detection only mode, without plan or apply steps, allows you to perform read-only drift detection. This feature is available since v0.8.0. Plan and Manual Approve : This feature allows you to separate the plan , out of the apply step, just like the Terraform workflow you are familiar with. A good thing about this is that it is done in a GitOps way. When a plan is generated, the controller shows you a message like 'set approvePlan: \"plan-main-123\" to apply this plan.' . You make change to the field .spec.approvePlan , commit and push to tell the TF-controller to apply the plan for you. With this GitOps workflow, you can optionally create and push this change to a new branch for your team member to review and approve too. This feature is available since v0.6.0. First-class YAML-based Terraform : The Terraform object in v0.13.0+ allows you to better configure your Terraform resources via YAMLs, but without introducing any extra CRDs to your cluster. Together with a new generator called Tofu-Jet , we'll now be able to ship pre-generated primitive Terraform modules for all major cloud providers. A primitive Terraform module is a module that only contains a single primitive resource, like aws_iam_role , or aws_iam_policy . With this concept, we would be able to use Terraform without writing Terraform codes, and make it more GitOps-friendly at the same time. This feature is available since v0.13.0. GitOps Dependency for Terraform : The Terraform object in v0.13.0+ allows you to specify a list of Terraform objects that it depends on. The controller will wait for the dependencies to be ready before it starts to reconcile the Terraform object. This allows you to create a dependency graph of your Terraform modules, and make sure the modules are applied in the correct order. Please use .spec.retryInterval (a small value like 20s ) to control the retry interval when using this feature. This feature is available since v0.13.0.

Assume that we have a ready-to-use OCI image with a primitive module for the imaginary resource aws_hello_world , and the image is tagged as ghcr.io/tf-controller/hello-primitive-modules/v4.32.0:v1 . We'll use the following Terraform object definition to provision the resource. First, we need to create a Terraform object with the spec.sourceRef.kind field set to OCIRepository and the spec.sourceRef.name field set to the name of the OCIRepository object. Second, we need to set the spec.path field to the name of the resource, in this case aws_hello_world . Third, we need to set the spec.values field to the values of the resource. This is a YAML object that will be converted to an HCL variable, and passed to the Terraform module. Finally, we need to set the spec.approvePlan field to auto to automatically approve the plan. --- apiVersion : source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2 kind : OCIRepository metadata : name : hello-package-v4.32.0 namespace : flux-system spec : interval : 30s url : oci://ghcr.io/tf-controller/hello-primitive-modules/v4.32.0 ref : tag : v1 --- apiVersion : infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1 kind : Terraform metadata : name : hello-world namespace : flux-system spec : path : aws_hello_world values : greeting : Hi subject : my world sourceRef : kind : OCIRepository name : hello-package-v4.32.0 interval : 1h0m approvePlan : auto","title":"Hello World Primitive Module"},{"location":"use_tf_controller/with_the_ready_to_use_AWS_package/","text":"Use TF-controller with the ready-to-use AWS package This document describes how to use the Weave TF-controller with the ready-to-use AWS package. It requires TF-controller v0.13+ to run the example. What is a package? A package is a collection of primitive Terraform modules that are bundled into an OCI image. You can think of a TF-controller's package as a thin wrapper around a Terraform module provider, and a TF-controller primitive module as a thin wrapper around a Terraform resource or a root module. We will provide a set of ready-to-use packages for the most popular cloud providers. Currently, we ship the package for AWS only. AWS Package To provide the out-of-the-box experience, the AWS Package is installed by default when you installed the TF-controller. Unlike other IaC implementation, our package model is designed to be very lightweight as a package is just a set of TF files in the form of OCI. Packages would not put any burden to your cluster. However, you can opt this package out by setting awsPackage.install: false in your Helm chart values.
